Just Compare is a web application that generates a summary of the differences in meaning between two texts. The application consists of a frontend developed with Streamlit, and a backend developed with Flask.

Currently, the user can enter a code on the Streamlit frontend, which sends a request to the Flask backend. The backend processes the request and sends back the output to the frontend. Please note that the code for this functionality is a placeholder logic code, and the application is still in development.

The backend has been containerized using Docker to ensure reproducibility, scalability, and consistency of the code in various environments.
